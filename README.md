NBA Blog - CS50x Final Project

Welcome to the NBA Blog, a simple yet engaging platform to explore and stay updated on the latest NBA news and insights. This project is the culmination of my efforts in the CS50x course, where I aimed to create a user-friendly blog using HTML and CSS.
Introduction
The NBA Blog is a project that focuses on delivering NBA-related content in a clean and organized manner. The blog includes a homepage and an about me page to provide users with an overview of the content and me.
Homepage
The homepage is the central hub of the NBA Blog, showcasing a collection of articles. Each article is summarized, and readers can click the "Read More" button to access the full article.

About Me Page
Get to know the person behind the NBA Blog on the "About Me" page. This section provides insights into my  background, passion for basketball, and the inspiration behind the blog.

Read More Button
The "Read More" button on the homepage allows users to delve deeper into articles that pique their interest. Clicking the button redirects users to the full article page.

Full Article Page
Each full article page provides an in-depth look at the selected topic. Scroll through the complete article and find a comment section at the bottom for user interaction.
